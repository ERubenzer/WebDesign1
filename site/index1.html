    <!-- Write a paragraph introducing yourself -->
    <p>I am a passionate and dedicated professional with a background in customer service and warehouse work.
       I have worked as a cashier at a dairy store for three years and have worked as a Heat Transfer warehouse
       worker for the past two summers. Outside of work I dedicate myself to curling, which I have been doing so
        for the past 11 years.

    <span>The reason I am taking Web Design is because I believe it is well-suited to my strengths. I 
      love a good puzzle to solve and I also have a bit of an artistic side. My dad is a database administrator and I have had 
      time to see what working in this field could potentially be like. I am aware of the workload and prepared to take it on. 
      I know there are plenty of job opportunities with good pay if I decide to continue with this career path. There is also a
      very good chance I will be able to get a remote job which would be very helpful with my current athletic goals and my dream
      of having a family some day.
